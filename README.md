Creating Log in, sign-up and log out pages by using HTML and PHP languages. 
To make our previous website a complete site in all respects, we create some pages by using HTML and PHP  languages that support the site and make it more user-friendly.

â€¢ Registration page
On this page, the user can enter a username, password, and Email to register. After the blanks are filled the user 
can click the Register button then it shows the message on a different page that the registration is completed 
successfully.

Log-in page
On this page, the user can enter a username and password to log in. After log in completely the system converts 
it to the robot arm control panel page.
